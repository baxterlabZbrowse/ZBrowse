Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function.  It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a ""closed"" conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an ""open"" conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.","AT1G04400"

LEC1 shared high similarity with other HAP3 homologs only in central, B domain. LEC1 is required for the specification of cotyledon identity and the completion of embryo maturation. It was sufficient to induce embryogenic programs in vegetative cells, suggesting that LEC1 is a major embryonic regulator that mediates the switch between embryo and vegetative development. Mutants are desiccation intolerant, have trichomes on cotyledons and exhibit precocious meristem activation. Levels of the ABI3 and FUS3 transcripts were significantly reduced in developing siliques of the lec1-1 mutants, indicating that LEC1 down-regulates FUS3 and ABI3.When LEC1 is overexpressed from an inducible promoter, the expression of numerous genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis is increased suggesting a role in positive regulation of FA biosynthesis.","AT1G21970"

MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible.

The protein was determined to have peroxidase activity. This activity is thought to be dependent on the presence of post-translational modifications (most likely phosphorylation). The protein was shown to be present as a mixture of monomer and homodimer. The homodimerization seems to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or H2O2. The dimerization was prevented by the addition of DTT, &#946;-mercaptoethanol and TCEP. Annat1 mRNA is expressed in flowers, roots,leaves and stems and is most abundant in stems. mRNA levels are increased in response to oxidative stress.  Developmental expression patterns suggest a role in Golgi-mediated polysaccharide secretion.

ATMLO6 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO2, AtMLO3 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots and lateral root primordia, in flower and fruit abscission zone, in vascular system of cotyledons, young leaves and petals, in mature rosette leaves, in anthers, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).","AT1G61560"

Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.","AT1G68910"

The protein has similarity to the mandelonitrile lyase family of FAD containing oxidoreductases and is predicted to be secreted (SignalP).It is expressed in all tissue layers of roots, inflorescences, stems, leaves, and flowers and is also expressed in siliques. Expression is highest in inflorescence and flower tissue.Transmission of mutant alleles to the progeny shows non mendelian segregation- a percentage of mutant alleles revert back to a previous parental (e.g. grandparental) wild type allele. It has been suggested that an RNA template driven or other extra-DNA genomic mechanism may be responsible for the non-mendelian inheritance of HTH. Reversion events in alleles at other loci have also been observed to occur in plants with an hth mutant background indicating a genome wide effect.","AT1G72970"

PIN1 is involved in the determination of leaf shape by actively promoting development of leaf margin serrations.  In roots, the protein mainly resides at the basal end of the vascular cells, but weak signals can be detected in the epidermis and the cortex.  Expression levels and polarity of this auxin efflux carrier change during primordium development suggesting that cycles of auxin build-up and depletion accompany, and may direct, different stages of primordium development.

These data suggest that AGL61 and 80 together are required for proper differentiation of the central cell.","AT2G24840"

Belongs to a large gene family called CLE for CLAVATA3/ESR-related.  Encodes a stem cell-specific protein CLV3 presumed to be a precursor of a secreted peptide hormone.  The deduced ORF encodes a 96-amino acid protein with an 18-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide.  The functional form of CLV3 (MCLV3) was first reported to be a posttranscriptionally modified 12-amino acid peptide, in which two of the three prolines were modified to hydroxyproline (Ito et al., Science 2006, 313:842; Kondo et al., Science 2006, 313:845).  Ohyama et al. (2009) later reported that the active mature CLV3 is a 13-amino-acid arabinosylated glycopeptide (Nature Chemical Biology, 5:578).  CLV3 binds the ectodomain of the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor-kinase. Regulates shoot and floral meristem development. Required for CLAVATA1 receptor-like kinase assembly into a signaling complex that includes KAPP and a Rho-related protein.  It restricts its own domain of expression, the central zone (CZ) of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), by preventing differentiation of peripheral zone cells, which surround the CZ, into CZ cells and restricts overall SAM size by a separate, long-range effect on cell division rate. CLE domain of CLV3 is sufficient for function. Results obtained from whole seedlings challenge the concept that the immune receptor FLS2 perceives the meristematic regulatory peptide CLV3p in mesophyll, seedlings, and SAM cells and that CLV3p contributes to SAM immunity against bacterial infection (PMID:22923673).","AT2G27250"

The protein is an iron-sulfur cluster protein predicted to catalyze the conversion of 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) to hydroxymethylpyrimidine (HMP) or  hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate (HMP-P). A severe reduction of THIC levels in plants decreases vitamin B1 (thiamin diphosphate (TPP)) levels and also leads to changes in the levels of numerous other metabolites since so many primary metabolic enzymes require a TPP co-factor. thiC mutants are chlorotic and arrest in their development at the cotyledon stage. A N-terminal targeting sequence directs the THIC protein to the chloroplast stroma. A conserved TPP-binding site is located in the 3' UTR of the At2g29630.2 gene model, and is predicted to function as a riboswitch. The riboswitch controls the  formation of transcripts with alternative 3' UTR lengths, which affect mRNA accumulation and protein production. THIC transcripts are observed in seedlings 5 or more days after germination, and light promotes the expression of this gene.  Recessive mutant isolated by Redei.

The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal, stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing, stamen formation, and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5, ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium, consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.

The activation requires a functional MYB recognition element (MRE). Results from the myb12-1f allele indicate that an activation domain might be present in the C-terminus. Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol), while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines, but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12, flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent, suggesting functional redundancy.  The redundant factors are MYB11 and MYB111 although MYB12 is primarily required for flavonol biosynthesis in roots.

Expression of ARR22 transcripts appears to be localized to the chalaza and to be induced by wounding. Ectopic expression of ARR in other parts of the plant leads to reduced cytokinin-related responses and impaired root, shoot, and flower development. Overexpression of wild-type ARR22 in an arr22 mutant background causes variable defects in plant growth and fertility. But, in the same ar22 background, over-expression of versions of ARR22 that should act as dominant-negative or constitutively active proteins, based on mutations to the conserved Asp residue, do not show any phenotypic abnormalities, raising the possibility that these may not act as canonical response regulators.","AT3G04280"

It has been identified as a suppressor of Bax-induced cell death by functional screening in yeast and can also suppress Bax-induced cell death in tobacco plants. Overexpression of this gene in tobacco BY-2 cells confers resistance to H2O2 and heat stresses. Overexpression in Arabidopsis causes upregulation of PDF1.2 and GST6.

Full length ABI3 protein binds to the highly conserved RY motif [DNA motif CATGCA(TG)], present in many seed-specific promoters, and the B3 domains of this transcription factor is necessary for the specific interaction with the RY element. Transcriptional activity of ABI3 requires the B3 DNA-binding domain and an activation domain. In addition to the known N-terminal-located activation domain, a second transcription activation domain was found in the B1 region of ABI3. ABI3 is essential for seed maturation. Regulator of the transition between embryo maturation and early seedling development. Putative seed-specific transcriptional activator. ABI3 is a central regulator in ABA signaling and is unstable in vivo.  It interacts with and can by polyubiquitinated by AIP2 in vivo. Based on double mutant analyses, ABI3 interacts genetically with both FUS3 and LEC1 and is involved in controlling accumulation of chlorophyll and anthocyanins, sensitivity to abscisic acid, and expression of the members of the 12S storage protein gene family.

Bacterial avirulence (Avr) effectors AvrB, AvrRpm1, and AvrRpt2 induce a mobility shift in RIN4 and expression of AvrRpt2 induces rapid degradation of RIN4. RIN4 contains 2 sites for AvrRpt2 autocleavage, called RCS1 and RCS2. Overexpression of RIN4 inhibits multiple phenotypes associated with AvrRpt2 function and also inhibits PAMP-induced defense signaling. Attached to the plasma membrane at its carboxyl terminus. Cleaved  by AvrRpt2 at two PxFGxW motifs, one releasing a large portion of RIN4 from the  plasma membrane and both exposing amino-terminal residues that destabilized the carboxyl-terminal cleavage products by targeting them for N-end ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation.

A putative xyloglucan O-acetyltransferase. TBL gene family has 46 members, two of which (TBR/AT5G06700 and TBL3/AT5G01360) have been shown to be involved in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, presumably by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers.

Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM2 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs.","AT3G49670"

It is also required to regulate the floral meristem activity by modulating the extent of expression of WUS and AG.  In other eukaryotes, this protein is recruited to specific promoters by DNA binding transcription factors and is thought to promote transcription by acetylating the N-terminal tail of histone H3. The enzyme has indeed been shown to catalyse primarily the acetylation of H3 histone with only traces of H4 and H2A/B being acetylated. Non-acetylated H3 peptide or an H3 peptide that had been  previously acetylated on K9 both serve as excellent substrates  for HAG1-catalyzed acetylation. However, prior acetylation  of H3 lysine 14 blocks radioactive acetylation of the  peptide by HAG1.  HAG1 is specific for  histone H3 lysine 14.","AT3G54610"

Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1), consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A, B, C, D, E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain, a central ?dynamin 2? domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED), a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.  The edr3 mutation causes a P77L substitution in the G2 motif of the GTPase domain of DRP1E.  edr3 mutant Arabidopsis plants display enhanced cell death in response to powdery mildew infection.","AT3G60190"

A putative 24 amino-acid signal peptide may direct this protein to the secretory system and it has been detected in cell wall apoplastic fluid.

Separase is a capase family protease required for the release of sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis and mitosis.  Arabidopsis separase contains a predicted 2Fe2S-ferredoxin domain that is not present in the proteins of other organisms. Also contains a putative EF-hand calcium binding domain. Mutant seeds exhibited embryo arrest at the globular stage. The endosperm also exhibited a weak titan-like phenotype. Transgenic plants expressing AESP RNA interference (RNAi) from the meiosis-specific DMC1 promoter exhibited alterations in chromosome segregation during meiosis I and II that resulted in polyads containing from one to eight microspores. Plays an essential role in embryo development.  Required for the removal of cohesin from meiotic chromosomes and establishment of meiotic nuclear domains. This gene was also identified through the rsw4 mutant. Lines carrying recessive, temperature-sensitive mutations exhibit reduced anisotropic growth at 30 degrees Celsius. Microtubules and cellulose microfibrils are not depleted or disoriented in the mutants at the restrictive temperature.","AT4G22970"

GTG2 binds to GPA1, the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein.  GPA1 (in its GTP-bound state) affects the GTP binding and GTPase activity of GTG2 and may act to down-regulate GTG2 binding to ABA. GTG2 is widely expressed throughout the plant and appears to be involved in the regulation of several ABA-dependent responses including seed germination, plant development, and promotion of stomatal closure.

One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization. Generally, it is suggested that the complete LD is the determinant of subcellular sorting in both animal and plant R-SNAREs.","AT4G32150"

BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution.  Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus.","AT4G39400"

JKD can interact with the SCR and SHR proteins implicated in root patterning, as well as another zinc finger transcription factor, MAGPIE. All of these interactions require the first zinc finger in JKD according to a Y2H assay. There are also transcriptional interactions among these proteins. The initiation of JKD transcription does not appear to depend on SCR and SHR, but later expression in the post-embryonic QC cells and ground tissue initials is reduced in scr and shr mutants. JKD also appears to be required for SCR transcription beginning in the embryo. There is also some evidence that JKD plays a role in promoting the movement of SHR into the nucleus, particularly in QC cells, but this may be indirect.","AT5G03150"

Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.","AT5G11390"

This protein has an N-terminal PHD domain and two RING domains surrounding an SRA domain. The protein has been shown to bind to methylated cytosines of CG, CNG and CNN motifs via its SRA domain but has a preference for the former. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in vitro with members of the UBC8 family E2s. Either of the two RING domains present in the protein can promote ubiquitylation in vitro, but, not the PHD domain. Over-expression of ORTH1/VIM3 leads to decreased levels of FWA methylation, increased levels of FWA transcripts, and delayed flowering. Cen180 repeats are also hypomethylated in plants overexpressing this protein.","AT5G39550"

The protein has several domains, including C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat motifs which act in binding the C-terminal ""SKL"" targeting signal.  The mechanism of transport has been worked out in other organisms:  The receptor recognizes and binds cytosolic PTS1-containing proteins.  The PEX5-PTS1 complex binds a PEX14/PEX13 receptor complex at the peroxisome membrane and is translocated into the peroxisome matrix in a process dependent on PEX2,PEX10, and PEX12.  In the peroxisome matrix, PEX5 releases its cargo and is recycled to the cytosol in a process dependent on PEX1, PEX4, PEX6 and PEX22.  It is also involved, in conjunction with PEX7, in PTS1- and PTS2-dependent peroxisomal protein import.

Root-specific role in the transport of auxin. Acts downstream of CTR1 and ethylene biosynthesis, in the same pathway as EIN2 and AUX1, and independent from EIN3 and EIN5/AIN1 pathway. In the root, the protein localizes apically in epidermal and lateral root cap cells and predominantly basally in cortical cells. Functions may be regulated by phosphorylation status. EIR1 expression is induced by brassinolide treatment in the brassinosteroid-insensitive br1 mutant. Gravistimulation resulted in asymmetric PIN2 distribution, with more protein degraded at the upper side of the gravistimulated root. Protein turnover is affected by the proteasome and by endosomal cycling. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. Membrane sterol composition is essential for the acquisition of  PIN2 polarity.","AT5G57090"

Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.","AT5G58230"
